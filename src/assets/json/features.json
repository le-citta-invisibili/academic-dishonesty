Perhaps the most substantial lesson I've learned is the importance of understanding what it feels like to decide to do the wrong thing, and being able to identify the traits of misdoers in yourself. I describe these ideas in more detail in my letter to the community, enclosed at the bottom of my abstract; I invite you to give it a read.",

A number of factors influence that likelihood, including elements of student demographics and campus culture. For several reasons, including the liberal arts nature of academic programs, de-emphasis of grades, and strong community engagement with the Honor Code, I suspect that the proporton at Haverford is somewhat lower.",

Informally or by way of paid sites known as esssay mills, students pay another person to write essays for them. Flabbergastingly, about 16% of students report having paid someone for schoolwork. I know firsthand that writing papers can be unpredictably time-consuming; the students interviewed in this piece cite time pressure as a major reason for their actions.",
